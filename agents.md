## Repository Safety Policy

This repository is public and open-source.

- Never commit secrets, credentials, tokens, private keys, state files, or backups.
- Never commit real internal domains, hostnames, IP ranges, MAC addresses, node names, or other network topology details.
- Use placeholder values in examples (`example.invalid`, RFC5737 IP ranges, synthetic MACs).
